# ICS Security
 Project Name: ICS security resources

 This project is all about ICS Security. In an effort to contribute to the ICS community.

 1- Wordlists

I created two separate  wordlist files for both  usernames and passwords . I will update the files regularly whenever I find new words. The words were extracted from the following sources:

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/scada-pass.csv

http://scadasecuritybootcamp.com/SCADA-Default-Password-List.php
