# ICS Security
 **Project Name: ICS security** 

 This project is all about ICS Security. In an effort to contribute to the ICS community.

 1- Wordlists

I created two separate  wordlist files for both  usernames and passwords . I will update the files regularly whenever I find new words. 

2- Gas/Cylinder Matlab model

I created (co-author) this model during my doctorate research program. The files are in the model folder.

3- Dorks: Find ICS devices in search engines :bomb: :warning: 
* Shodan : ABB , BACnet, conpot, fuel tank, knx , moxa, opcua, rockwell, siemens, spacelynk, spidercontrol, tekon, wago, yokogawa
* Censys : ATG, BACNET, CITRIX, CODESYS, DIGI, DNP3, EIP, FINS, FOX, GE_SRTP, IEC61850_5_104, MODBUS, PCWORX, PRO_CON_OS, S7, WDRPC

4- Metasploit Modules for ICS 

5- ICS exploits and files in Exploit database 

6- Wireshark filters for ICS protocols 

7- ICSFile : A tool to search for ICS file extensions

8- icsfinder : This tool checks for open ICS ports for a given host 

9- Nmap ICS-OT Scripts : A collection ICS/OT Nmap scripts

10- A curated list of resources that I recommend for those interested in learning about Industrial Control Systems Cyber Security. 

11- ICS/OT Simulation & TestBed
