# GAS CYLINDER FILLING MODEL

This Simulink model is based on physical properties given to me in an interview with a senior engineer whose employer is a gas producer organization that implements ICS technologies. The interview dealt with questions such as the real-world risks and impacts of a serious malfunction occurring either intentionally (from malicious third parties), or unintentionally from internal errors and malfunctions. The physical properties of a gas cylinder are mass of a cylinder (empty and full) and cylinder volume. Other properties are filling time and gas flow rate. The goal of our model is to simulate real physical aspects of a gas cylinder process.

Files:
 - gas_cylinder_model_code.txt : The model Matlab code (POC)

 - model_physical_property : The physical properties of cylinder and gas.

Aim and goal:

This project can be used to simulate physical propertie of ICS (industrial control systems) and can be used to develop cyber threat modeling scenarios or testbeds.

Requirement: You need a software (eg. Matlab/Simulink)to run this code. 

Enjoy !
